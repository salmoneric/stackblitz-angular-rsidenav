  <h3>The Roots of Thought: Prehistoric Philosophy</h3>

  <p>
    While the term "philosophy" traditionally refers to formal systems of
    thought emerging in ancient civilizations, prehistoric humans undoubtedly
    engaged in proto-philosophical reflection. Cave paintings (like those at
    Lascaux, c. 17,000 BCE) and burial rituals (such as Neanderthal flower
    burials at Shanidar Cave) suggest early humans contemplated existential
    questions—the nature of life and death, humanity's relationship to animals,
    and possibly spiritual realms beyond immediate perception.

    Archaeological evidence reveals three key philosophical preoccupations in
    preliterate societies:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cosmology:</strong> Neolithic structures like Stonehenge (3000
      BCE) demonstrate sophisticated astronomical observation, implying attempts
      to understand humanity's place in cosmic order.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ethics:</strong> Tribal artifacts show care for disabled members
      (e.g., 45,000-year-old remains of a healed amputee in Borneo), suggesting
      early moral frameworks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ontology:</strong> Animistic figurines (Venus of Willendorf,
      28,000 BCE) hint at primal inquiries into the essence of being and
      fertility.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These manifestations lack written arguments, but as philosopher Lucien
    Lévy-Bruhl observed, prehistoric thought likely operated through
    "participation mystique"—a worldview where humans, nature, and symbols were
    interconnected through non-logical but meaningful relationships. This
    contrasts with later Greek rationality but may represent philosophy's
    embryonic form: the human mind seeking patterns and meaning before the
    advent of formal logic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Contemporary scholars debate whether prehistoric thought constitutes true
    philosophy. Figures like Wilhelm Dilthey argued that myth and ritual were
    philosophy's precursors, while others maintain that critical reasoning
    distinguishes proper philosophy from primal speculation. Regardless, these
    early cognitive leaps laid groundwork for all subsequent human inquiry.
